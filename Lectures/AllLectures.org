#+BEGIN_VERSE
Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
*When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;*
*What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?*
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

#+BEGIN_VERSE
" . . . is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern, a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself contains the answer to the question of the meaning of our life. Therefore this concern is unconditionally serious and shows a willingness to sacrifice any finite concern which is in conflict with it. The predominant religious name for the content of such a concern is God -- a god or gods.”

:STEP: t

#+BEGIN_VERSE
" . . . is a system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."
-- Clifford Geertz, 1966

#+BEGIN_VERSE
“...while there is a staggering amount of data, phenomena, of human experiences and expressions that might be characterized in one culture or another, by one criterion or another, as religion - there is no data for religion. Religion is solely the creation of the scholar's study. It is created for the scholar's analytic purposes by his imaginative acts of comparison and generalization. Religion has no existence apart from the academy.”
#+END_VERSE
** Conflict Thesis
- Appears most vividly in c. 19, e.g.
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules; and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been fairly opposed, the latter has been forced to retire from the lists, bleeding and crushed if not annihilated; scotched, if not slain."
-- T. H. Huxley, 1859

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Ancient Egyptians, Nut, the sky goddess, wrapped the earth-god Geb in an embrace; out of this embrace were born Isis, Osiris, Set and Nepthys, among the most important gods in the pantheon.
  - intimacy of this image speaks to the direct experience of the sky: as remote and magestic, but also immediate, surrounding, encompassing.  Terrifying at times, but also deeply familiar to most inhabitants of many cultures.

many reasons to observe night sky. 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear appear appear)
- regularities in seasons (calendars
- navigation
- clues to behaviour of supernatural beings
- fundamental nature and behaviour of the natural world 
- *Differs with time and place!*
** Ancient Babylon
- Powerful city-state/civilization in Mesopotamia, with a history of some 2500-3000 years (depending on how it's counted.
- Earliest known written records of astronomical observation, beginning ~2000 BCE.  
- Astonishingly precise, to the point of being able to predict certain lunar eclipses. ("Saros Cycle" of 18 yrs + 11.3 days)

*** Cosmology
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
- complex multi-generational pantheon, probbably indicating some history of conquest and reconquest

*** Divination
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear appear)
- symmetry and /complementarity/ between Heaven and Earth
- astronomical events as a kind of *cosmic writing* from the Gods to mortal observers
- hints as to /destiny/, or /hidden order/; but not themselves /causal agents/ of events (contrast to Greece!)
- Therefore, important members of the court
  - How to ward off effects of predicted disasters? 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The signs in the sky, just like those on earth, give us signals
- Ancient textbook, cited in F. Rochberg, "Mesopotamian Cosmology", p. 47
#+END_QUOTE

*** Astronomy in service of Astrology
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
- increasing perfection of astronomy --> better timing e.g. of public ritual
- More and more phenomena described as *regular*
  - fewer and fewer are therefore /portents/, or sky writing
- Transition by 5th Century BCE to /birth charts/ and away from royal divination
  - correspondence between *meaning-laden positions of planets & other celestial phenomena* and *personal destiny*
  - this *horoscopic* technique survives into Greece & Rome & is revived in medieval Europe

*** Babylon: Summary
- Long history of precise empirical astronomical observation
- observation has very little impact on /model/ of the heavens, suggesting very different epistemological framework
- Insetead, astronomy primarily serves astrology

** Chinese Astronomy
- earliest records appear much later, about 300 BCE
- several competing cosmological models
- relation between /astronomy/ and /astrology/ similar, but with important differences

*** Models of the Earth
- /gai tian/ dome model

- /shuen ye/ infinite model
https://www.ied.edu.hk/apfslt/v6_issue2/liusc/image017.png

*** Purpose of Observation
- all astronomical observation concerned with /relation between the heavens and human activity./
- mostly /portent/ astrology
- division between /li/ (calendars) and /tian wen/ (sky patterns)
  - regular and atypical events
- gradual absorptuion of certain /tian wen/ by /li/

*** Possibilty of novelty
- in contrast to Greek thought (see next week!), heavens /not/ an unchanging separate sphere
- instead, universe a single /organism/ in which health or illness manifests in /both/ terrestrial & celestial realms
- portents not /messages/ but /causes or results/ of terrestrial actions
- therefore: particular attention to /new phenomena/.
  - e.g., Novae

*** Chinese Astronomy: Summary
- Impossibility to separate "scientific" from "unscientific" elements of astronomical observation
- sophisticated written records, with substantial predictive power & meticulous recording of anomolies
- descriptions of the /nature of the heavens/ seems secondary.

*** His Importance

-  in medieval writings often just called “The Philosopher”
-  laid out a system of knowledge that persisted for thousands of years
-  helped lay foundations for theological & natural philosophic writings
   in /at least/ christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions
-  combined an emphasis on /precise empirical observation/ with
   /rigorous deduction/

*** Aristotle's Style and System

-  abandons dialogue
-  Builds a (largely!) self-consistent system across many fields of
   inquiry

** Aristotle's Natural Philosophy

four causes, Natures, and theory of motion at the heart of his physcial
theories

-  all natural phenomena must be explained in terms of these principles

*** Four Causes

-  Material
-  Formal
-  Efficient
-  final

*** Natures and Motion

-  /Nature/ of a being or substance explains its actions.

   -  nature of earth is to be at rest
   -  nature of fire is to move

-  When a body's's state of being not in accord with its *nature*, that
   is because some /efficient/ cause is /acting on/ that body

** The Heavens

-  Terrestrial bodies, with their tendency to rest or move
   “rectilearly”, also initiate in each other processes of change
-  Celestial bodies are unchangeable, and embedded in a fifth element,
   *Ether* or *Aether*

   -  move in a /circular/ fashion

*** The Spheres

Aristotle gets this from Eudoxus:

-  Concentric spheres of aether rotate around the earth (center of
   Universe)
-  each has its own motion, but is also carried by the motion of the
   outer sphere

[[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebunn/homocentric/retrograde3.gif]]

*** But Where does this motion come from?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [E]verything that is in motion is moved by something... the first
  principle that directly causes things that are in motion to be moved
  is that which moves itself, and the first principle of the whole
  series is the unmoved....

  So the necessity that there should be motion continuously requires
  that there should be a first movement that is unmoved even
  accidentally...
#+END_QUOTE

There must be an Unmoved Mover! As perhaps an efficient but *certainly*
a final cause

-  there may even be *Many* unmoved movers

*** And how did it start?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  So the necessity that there should be motion continuously requires
  that there should be a first movement that is unmoved even
  accidentally, if... thre is to be in the world of things an unceasing
  and undying motion, and the world is to remain permanently
  self-contained... for if the first principle is permanent, the
  universe must also be permanent, if it is continuous with the first
  principle.
#+END_QUOTE

There can be no “first” motion!

(Because every motion or change requires a previous state of change)

** The divine

-  The “Unmoved Mover”, as cause of everything that is, is divine
-  however, this entity is not *within* the universe

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time,
  outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there, is of such a nature as
  not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; nor is there any change
  in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost motion; they
  continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified,
  living the best and most self sufficient of lives... From [the
  fulfilment of the whole heaven] derive the being and life which other
  things, some more or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy.
#+END_QUOTE

-  in fact, in its perfection, the unmoved mover *has no awareness of
   the world* but *solely contemplates itself*

** Aristotle: Summary

-  Homocentric Celestial Spheres!
-  An Eternal Universe!
-  An Eternal, self-contemplating God!
-  a *De-sacralized* Nature!

** The Ptolemaic system

-  Ptolemy: CE 90-168; Greek-speaking Egyptian living in Alexandria
   under Roman rule
-  inherited idea of celestial spheres from
   Eudoxus/Aristotle/Hipparchus;
-  and stellar observation records potentially from ancient
   Mesopotamians

*** The Physical Model

-  Homocentric spheres, severla for each planet, like those described by
   Aristotle
-  Much more carefully specified!

*** The Mathematical Model

-  Uniform Circular motions, in “superposition”, to create complex
   motions
-  Techniques: epicycles and equants

   -  account for complexities of movements

*** Persistence and Problematics

-  Incredibly resilient
-  Corrections make it increasingly heavy with adjustments
-  Copernicus will eventually find it simpler to move the sun to the
   center of the system (to eliminate equants)

** Sum-up

-  Two very different /methods/ to understanding the heavens

** Recap
- Ptolemaic Astronomy & Cosmology
- Platonic and Aristotelian conceptions of "God"
  - as evidenced in the spheres
- Empirical "vs" Deductive approaches to Natural Knowledge
** Apologies!
- I'm late!!!
** Synopsis
Various Encounters with Ancient Philosophy:
- Al-Farabi (~872-950, Baghdad): "The Second Teacher"
- ibn Sina or Avicenna (~980-1037, Uzbekistan & Eastern Iran): a naturalistic theology & epistemology
- al Ghazali (1058-1111, Tus & Baghdad): /The Incoherence of the Philosopohers/
- ibn Rushd or Averroes (1126-1198,Córdoba and Marrakesh): monopsychism and rationalism
** Islam
- 7th Century revelation
- Rapid spread from Mecca
- Absorption and replacement of other monotheisms & anymist/polytheistic religions
  - despite tolerant regimes in many areas

*** Medieval spread of Islam

*** To remember!
- immense philosophical & theological diversity over ~500 years
- enormous empire of many languages and ethnicities
- openness to local intellectual resources
- absurd to speak of "the Islamic" /anything/, esp., say, "the Islamic view of science"
** Islam and Greek Philosophy
- Resuscitation of Ancient Traditions
- Massive Greek \rarr Arabic Translation Effort, esp. in 'Abbasid Calophate (750-1258)
*** Making Translation Possible
- Even the Romans had translated only small parts of Greek classical corpus
- Why now?
  - Institutionalization of Arabic
  - Tolerance towards non-Muslim scholars
  - Patronage system
  - Emphasis w/in Islam on scholarly investigation
*** Reason, Faith, and Aristotle
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
According to various sources, the caliph was visited one night by Aristotle,
who granted him a series of questions. The caliph began with the
all-important one, “What is good?” to which the immediate answer was
“That which is good in the mind.” “And what then?” The answer: “That
which is good in law.”
#+END_QUOTE
*** Pre-Eminence of Aristotle
Two Traditions
- "Aristotelians": Aristotle as "The First Teacher", creator of a complete system
- "Neoplatonists": Plato as /completion/ of the Aristoelian system
  - esp, correcting gaps within Aristotle's metaphysics
- Philosophy as, in part, program of reconciling
  - /Aristotle with Himself/ and then
  - /Aristotle with Plato/ and finally
  - /Aristotle with Divine Revelation/
*** Emanations...
#+ATTR_HTML: :style max-width:49%; max-height 70%
[[file:~/RLG231/Images/Ptolemaicsystem-emanations.png]]
- Aristotle's God was /distant/
- Islam's God was /active/
*** And Other Questions
- Prophecy
  - Aristotle was /critical/ of notion of prophecy
  - Islam was /founded/ on prophecy
- The Soul
  - Aristotle saw the soul as a /formal/ cause of the self; was perhaps immanent to this life
  - Islam proclaimed the /immortality/ of the soul
- the World
  - Aristotle thought events had /natural causes/;
  - Islam saw God acting /directly in the world/ through /miracles/ 
** /Kalam/ and /falsafa/
Early division of "Transmitted" and "rationalized" knowledge
- with, for many, /reason/ at the root of both
- /kalam/ and /falsafa/
** Al-Farabi: The Second Teacher
- cosmopolitan 9th Century Baghdad
- Hellenized christian philosophy
- canonical version of /emanation/ theory
- a /rationalist/ metaphysics that nonetheless exalted God as the cause of all things
  - God's knowledge as "cause and source of the existence of everything."
*** Cosmology
- Everything needs a cause
- Aristotelian "Prime Mover" an expression of God's /intellect/
  - All that is as an outcome of God's will
  - bridge from *first cause* to an *engaged, interested, active God*
- Our intellects /shaped by/ God's emanations as themy move through the spheres
*** Cosmology
#+ATTR_HTML: :style max-width:49%; max-height 70%
[[file:~/RLG231/Images/Farabi-emanations.png]]
*** Psychology
- "First Intellect" \rarr God
- "Second Intellect" \rarr Incorruptible heavenly bodies
- "Active Intellect" \rarr unites God 7 human consciousness, but acts in the corruptible world
** Avicenna
- child prodigy ("By the age of 18, there was nothing I did not know")
- highly successful practicing physician
- great systematizer of philosophy
*** Avicenna and Aristotle
- Aristotle is great, bu:
- Knowledge is /progressive/ and can be improved upon
- system and empiricism work together
*** Naturalism
- lving things
- the Cosmos
- mind
- revelation
*** Logic at the root
- Syllogism: A \rarr B \rarr C
- how do we apprehend the "middle term"?
*** Human Intellect
- "congeneric" substance w/ divine intellect
  but resident in corruptible terrestrial sphere
- hence /mutable/ and potential
- intellection a process of /self-development/ that /stretches/ towards the incorruptible intellects above.  
*** The Soul
- all "intelligibles" /object's of god's thoughts/
  - Divine Intellect overses things through their causes, but we only see /effects/
- logical syllogism a /process of contact/ between human and divine intellects
- ... as is prophecy
  - prophecy rendered *naturalistic*
*** The work of Reason
- Reason as /habit which permits this (limited) divine contact/
- "Intimacy" of acquaintance with reason and object facilitates this apprehension
- *truths* and *divine intellect* eternal; *terrestrial knowledge* is progressive
- This is true, also, of /self-knowledge/, which we gain through similarly rationalistic means
- is this "mysticism"? *No*
*** The Soul, again
- Freed of the body, the soul has /potential/ to behold the causes
  - if it has been properly trained
- this is the nature of happiness and of paradise
*** An ethical Obligation
- duty to realize our intellects in their full potential
- an imperative to /refine/ and /perfect/ knowledge
** Al Ghazali
- Mystic and theologian
- /Incoherence of the Philosophers/
- mixed legacy
** Averroes
- "Pure" Aristotelianism

  - God as remote /clockmaker/ and /lawgiver/
  - Greatly diminished sphere of divine activity
** Wonders and Miracles
- Medieval distinction btwn /supernatural/ and /preternatural/:
  - /supernatural/: God's direct intervention (miracles: /violation/ of natural law)
  - /preternatural/: intervention of demons, angels, magicians, nature itself to produce /exceptions/ to natural order (wonders: /exceptions/ to law)
  - one reason why /facts/ are never adequate to determine /natural law/ 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
God’s miracles violate only the lower order of causes, which exist only by God’s will, leaving the higher order of causes, which depend  on  necessity,  intact.  Miracles  are  God’s  unmediated  interventions  in  the  natural order, and hence “above nature.” (daston, "miraculous facts")

Hobbes: The proper domain of particulars, of facts, as they came to be called, was history, not philosophy: "The register of Knowledge of Fact is called History. Whereof there be two sorts: one called Naturall History; which is the History of such Facts, or Effects of Nature. ... The other is Civill History; which is the History of the Voluntary Actions of men in Common-wealths."47 History could contribute the raw materials and illustrations to natural philosophy-thus Aristotle's History of Animals was to prepare the way for a philosophical zoology-but by itself it was an inferior sort of knowledge, subordinated to the study of universals in philosophy or poetry.

*** The Eye as Mechanism
I know no better method of introducing so large a subject, than that of comparing a single thing with a single thing; an eye, for example, with a telescope. As far as the examination of the instrument goes, there is precisely the same proof that the eye was made for vision, as there is that the telescope was made for assisting it. They are made upon the same principles; both being adjusted to the laws by which the transmission and refraction of rays of light are regulated. I speak not of the origin of the laws themselves; but such laws being fixed, the construction, in both cases, is adapted to them.

    Sturmius held, that the examination of the eye was a cure for atheism. Beside that conformity to optical principles which its internal constitution displays, and which alone amounts to a manifestation of intelligence having been exerted in the structure... there is to be seen, in every thing belonging to it and about it, an extraordinary degree of care...

    What does chance ever do for us? In the human body, for instance, chance, i. e.the operation of causes without design, may produce a wen, a wart, a mole, a pimple, but never an eye. Amongst inanimate substances, a clod, a pebble, a liquid drop might be; but never was a watch, a telescope, an organized body of any kind, answering a valuable purpose by a complicated mechanism, the effect of chance. In no assignable instance hath such a thing existed without intention somewhere.

 Another mechanical contrivance, not unlike the last in its object, but different and original in its means, is seen in what anatomists call the fore-arm; that is, in the arm between the elbow and the wrist. Here, for the perfect use of the limb, two motions are wanted; a motion at the elbow backward and forward, which is called a reciprocal motion; and a rotatory motion, by which the palm of the hand, as occasion requires, may be turned upward. How is this managed? The forearm, it is well known, consists of two bones....

A single bone in the fore-arm, with a ball and socket joint at the elbow, which admits of motion in all directions, might, in some degree, have answered the purpose of both moving the arm and turning the hand. But how much better it is accomplished by the present mechanism...

*** Superfecundity 
- 1838: rereading Malthus
- overproduction; competition; struggle for existence
- how much greater in Nature!
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  A single pair of frogs might produce thousands of offspring every year!  Why was the world not overrun with frogs? (Browne, 387-8).  To overcome this superfecundity, there must be a kind of ‘war’ within the species, a competition for survival, a struggle for existence, that allowed only the strongest to survive.
  #+END_NOTES
*** Descent with Modification
- human breeders (framers, also hobbyists)
- /divergence/ of child from parent
- /forces/ in environment selecting
- /death/ as creative force
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  Was it possible that nature selected survivors as carefully as people selected breeders?  A natural selection analogous to artificial selection, that could account for both divergence of species and their adaptation to their environments?   Suppose 6 puppies born, he scribbled in his secret notebook:  some have longer legs than others.  in struggle for existence, maybe only two survive.  If some force in the environment favours long-legged dogs – whether natural or artificial – then in 10,000 years the long-legged breed would win out.  
  #+END_NOTES
*** Natural Selection and Adaptation
- /nature itself/ selecting descendants
- impersonal force explains adaptation
- no need for "intelligent designer"
#+BEGIN_NOTES
here was an explanation of evolution far more powerful than Lamarck’s 
– an explanation which relied on no metaphysical life force, an explanation which demanded no increasing perfection.  Species changed in the direction demanded by the environment; but that didn’t mean they got more perfect, just better-adapted.  All the theory needed was time – vast, unimaginable stretches of it.  And Lyell had already given Darwin as much time as he needed, and more.  
#+END_NOTES
*** The Theory, Summarized
- *Superfecundity*    (from Malthus) combined with
- *Descent with Modification* (from breeders) leads to a 
- *Struggle for Existence* (Malthus again) where survival rates are dictated by
- *Natural Selection*, by analogy to Artificial Selection (from breeders)
- Over *vast periods of time* (from Lyell),
- resulting in 
- the *divergence of species* (from Galápagos bird species) 
- and their seemingly perfect *adaptation* to their environment,
- into the full spectacle of *diversity* we see today.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The evolutionist guesses that there was a time when eyes were unknown -- that is a necessary part of the hypothesis... a piece of pigment.... appeared upo n the skin of an animal that had no eyes.  [It] converged the rays of the sun upon that spot and when the animal felt the heat... it turned the spot to the sun to get more heat.... [This] irritated the skin... and a nerve came there and out of the nerve came the eye!

- Evolution /dangerously immoral/
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Arguments against Evolution as "unscientific" are particularly /Baconian/: they see science as pure observation, stripped of theoretical apparatus.  

Also, beginnings of a prejudice agianst complexity. 

Bryan's Admission: "no objection to evolution before man but for the fact that a concession as tothe truth of evolution up to man furnishes our opponents with an argument which they are quick to use"

Speaking of the spirit that informs modern scientific investigations, I am of the opinion that all the finer speculations in the realm of science spring from a deep religious feeling, and that without such feeling they would not be fruitful. I also believe that, this kind of religiousness, which makes itself felt today in scientific investigations, is the only creative religious activity of our time. The art of today can hardly be looked. (Einstein, 1930, in Jammer, 2002)

I can, if worst comes to worst, still realize that God may have created a

I do not at all believe in human freedom in the philosophical sense. Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity.

TAGORE: What we call truth lies in the rational harmony be-
tween the subjective and objective aspects of reality, both of
which belong to the superpersonal man.

EINSTEIN: We do things with our mind, even in our everyday
3life, for which we are not responsible. The mind acknowledges
realities outside of it, independent of it. For instance, nobody
may be in this house, yet that table remains where it is.
TAGORE: Yes, it remains outside the individual mind, but not
the universal mind. The table is that which is perceptible by
some kind of consciousness we possess.

EINSTEIN: If nobody were in the house the table would exist all
the same, but this is already illegitimate from your point of view,
because we cannot explain what it means, that the table is there,
independently of us. Our natural point of view in regard to the
existence of truth apart from humanity cannot be explained or
proved, but it is a belief which nobody can lack—not even prim-
itive beings. We attribute to truth a superhuman objectivity. It
is indispensable for us—this reality which is independent of our
existence and our experience and our mind—though we cannot
say what it means.

TAGORE: In any case, if there be any truth absolutely unrelated
to humanity, then for us it is absolutely non-existing.

EINSTEIN: Then I am more religious than you are!

TAGORE: My religion is in the reconciliation of the superper-
sonal man, the universal spirit, in my own individual being.
