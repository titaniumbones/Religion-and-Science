** Consider the Moon
#+ATTR_HTML: :class paired
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Moon is a differentiated body: it has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius of 240 km (150 mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 km (190 mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 km (310 mi).[41] This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago.[42] Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust on top.[43]

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
who hast *set thy glory above the heavens.*
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies,
that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
*When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars,
which thou hast ordained;*
*What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
and the son of man, that thou visitest him?*
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;

#+BEGIN_VERSE
" . . . is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern, a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself contains the answer to the question of the meaning of our life. Therefore this concern is unconditionally serious and shows a willingness to sacrifice any finite concern which is in conflict with it. The predominant religious name for the content of such a concern is God -- a god or gods."

" . . . is a system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."
-- Clifford Geertz, 1966

:END:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
"...while there is a staggering amount of data, phenomena, of human experiences and expressions that might be characterized in one culture or another, by one criterion or another, as religion - there is no data for religion. Religion is solely the creation of the scholar's study. It is created for the scholar's analytic purposes by his [sic] imaginative acts of comparison and generalization. Religion has no existence apart from the academy."
#+END_VERSE
** Conflict Thesis
- Appears most vividly in c. 19, e.g.
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of every science as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules; and history records that whenever science and orthodoxy have been fairly opposed, the latter has been forced to retire from the lists, bleeding and crushed if not annihilated; scotched, if not slain."
-- T. H. Huxley, 1859

*** But what kind of conflict?
:PROPERTIES:
:STEP:     t
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: slide
:END:
- conflict of *knowledge and belief?*
- conflict of *political authority?*
- conflict of *practices*?
The very question of *conflict or harmony* presupposes *two coherent or singular entities that can confront each other*. But this may not be the case.
*** Methods
- Proceed with /openness/ regarding the /ontological status/ of both "science" and "religion"
- expect /differing results/ in divergent historical periods & areas of knowledge
** Hot Spots
Bearing in mind all of the above, "conflict between science and religion" has historically been concentrated in a few areas:
- cosmology
- human consciousness and the soul
- human origins
We will therefore spend a lot of our time investigating these topics

** NOMA
#+BEGIN_VERSE
We may, I think, adopt this word and concept to express the central point of this essay and the principled resolution of supposed "conflict" or "warfare" between science and religion. No such conflict should exist because each subject has a legitimate magisterium, or domain of teaching authority -- and these magisteria do not overlap (the principle that I would like to designate as NOMA, or "nonoverlapping magisteria"). *The net of science covers the empirical universe: what is it made of (fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The net of religion extends over questions of moral meaning and value.* These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry

- Ancient Egyptians, Nut, the sky goddess, wrapped the earth-god Geb in an embrace; out of this embrace were born Isis, Osiris, Set and Nepthys, among the most important gods in the pantheon.
  - intimacy of this image speaks to the direct experience of the sky: as remote and magestic, but also immediate, surrounding, encompassing.  Terrifying at times, but also deeply familiar to most inhabitants of many cultures.

**** The Conquest of Tiamat
#+BEGIN_VERSE
[Marduk] let fly an arrow and pierced her belly,
  He tore open her entrails and slit her inwards,
He bound her and extingueshed her life,
  He threw down her corpse and stood o nit.
After he had killed Tiamat, the leader,
  Her assembly dispersed, her host scattered...
[He] placede his feet on the lower parts of Tiamat
  And with his merciless club smashed her skull.
He severed her arteries
  And let the North Wind bear up (her blood) 
...
He split her into two like a dried fish:
  One half of her he set up and stretched out as the heavens.
He stretched the skin and appointed a watch
  With the instruction not to let her waters escape.
...
He ashioned heaenly stations for the great gods,
  And set up constellaitons, the patterns of the stars.
He Appoined the year, marked off divisions,
  And set up three stars each for the twelve months.

*** Purpose of Observation
- all astronomical observation concerned with /relation between the heavens and human activity./
- mostly /portent/ astrology
- division between /li/ (calendars) and /tian wen/ (sky patterns)
  - regular and atypical events
- gradual absorption of certain /tian wen/ by /li/

*** Possibilty of novelty
- in contrast to Greek thought (see next week!), heavens /not/ an unchanging separate sphere
- instead, universe a single /organism/ in which health or illness manifests in /both/ terrestrial & celestial realms
- portents not /messages/ but /causes or results/ of terrestrial actions
- therefore: particular attention to /new phenomena/.
  - e.g., Novae

*** Chinese Astronomy: Summary
- Impossibility to separate "scientific" from "unscientific" elements of astronomical observation
- sophisticated written records, with substantial predictive power & meticulous recording of anomolies
- descriptions of the /nature of the heavens/ seems secondary.

** New World Astronomy

*** Nature of Knowledge
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear appear appear)
- how to determine what to believe
  - textual sources, reason, observation
- all forms of argument from /authority/, not fully independent
- "ladenness" of observation: no /seeing/ without /understanding/
- "realism" and "instrumentalism"
#+BEGIN_NOTES
I'm not sure what this slide is for. 

I suppose it's as a reminder that debates about the nature of the heavens are not just about "what the heavens are like"; but about how we come to know anything at all. So when we look at such debates, there are layers behind what we are seeing at first. 

But emphasize especially:
- "reason" and "observation" *not the same thing*
- different *elements* of "scientificity", interpenetrating with cosmoloogy/religion

Realism/instrumentalism: What exactly is the relationship between the /theory/, the /observations/, and the /reality/> WIll become important for Galileo!!

*** Nature of Divinity                                           :noexport:
- Pagan Pantheon
  - Hesiod's /Theogony/?
- Socrates' monotheism?
  - The role of a demiurge
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Again, I have no idea what this is for. I'm not sure how this helps anything. 

Pagan society has a plenitude of Gods, like most (but not all) of the Mediterranean cultures from this period.  Hediod's /Theogony/ is one account of the beginning of the world that Greek culture inherits from around the 8th Century BCE (800-700); but by the time of Plato serious philosophy is diverging from this orthodoxy.  

The emerging notion of a single God becomes important as Platonism and pagan philosophy more generally becomes assimilated tothe Abrahamic religions (Islam, Xianity, Judaism)

Also /created/ vs /uncreated/ world; and, are there /rules/ that god cannot break? Do those rules come from the nature of the Unvierse or from the nature of God? 

#+END_NOTES
** Before Plato
- fragmentary evidence, much of which comes from Aristotle
- Interest in origins of matter/universe
-  /four elements/
  - is one *prior*?
- interest in shape/components of cosmos
  - geocentric spherical universe
- central question of *being* vs *becoming*
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The history of Presocratic philosophy in Greece is actually quite long and interesting.  Important to remember who says what. Anaximander, Pythagoras, Zeno,etc. 

Inheritance from Presocratics:
- Ionian tradition: ~600-500 BCE thales ff: which "element" is prior? Thales thinks water, Anaximander thinks fire...
- Pythagorean Tradition: number as that which is real, and which guides the universe, forming a kind of music.
- (PParmenides, Democritus, atomism -- don't mention this for now!!)

*** His Importance

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
...he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived,
and what its scope and ambitions properly are, and he so transformed
the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of
philosophy, as it is often conceived---a rigorous and systematic
examination of ethical, political, metaphysical, and epistemological
issues, armed with a distinctive method---can be called his invention.
(Stanford Enc. of Philosophy)
#+END_QUOTE

** Plato's epistemology
- Truth ascertained through reason alone
- pertains to an unchanging *world of forms*
- struggle to know is a process of moving past flickering illusions of our world

*** Allegory of the Cave
http://ethicsjusticeandsociety.voices.wooster.edu/files/2011/01/cave_small.jpg
*** Allegory of the Cave
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Compare the region which the eye reveals to the cave. Compare the light of the fire to the light of the sun. Compare the upward ascent to the contemplation of the upper world. Now you understand the mounting of the soul to the intellectual region. In the world of knowledge the Form of God is the limit for our inquiries and can barely be perceived. But, when perceived, we cannot but conclude that it is the source of all that is good and beautiful.
#+END_QUOTE
*** Status of the Natural World
- changeable and unfixed
- imperfect and flickering
- therefore, *not a source or object* of perfect knowledge
*** Sources of reliable knowledge
- mathematics
- aesthetic judgment
- principles of logic & dialogic argument
** Plato's cosmology

Circular motions, Crystal Spheres, and a divine Demiurge!
*** Primacy of Being over Becoming
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
that which is apprehended by intelligence and reason is always in the same state; but that which is conceived by opinion with the help of sensation and without reason, is always in a process of becoming and perishing and never really is...

The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair and perfect; but when he looks to the created only, and uses a created pattern, it is not fair or perfect (Timaeus, 28)
#+END_QUOTE
*** Purpose of Astronomy

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
These sparks that paint the sky, since they are decorations on a
visible surface, we must regard... as the fairest and most exact of
material things, but we must recognize that they fall far short of the
truth, the movements, namely, of real speed and real slowness in true
number and in all true figures... These [true things] can be
apprehended only by reason and thought, but not by sight, or do you
think otherwise? -- Socrates, in /Republic/ VII 529:d

Now everything that becomes or is created must of necessity be created by some cause, for without a cause nothing can be created. The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must
necessarily be made fair and perfect, but when he looks to the created only and uses a created pattern, it is not fair of perfect. 
(Timaeus 28:b)
#+END_QUOTE

*** The Cosmos is a Copy

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The world has been framed *in the likeness* of that which is apprehended by reason and mind as unchageable. (Timaeus 29:a)
#+END_QUOTE

But it is an /imperfect/ copy thereof

*** The Cosmos, though imperfect, is divine

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
...he made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a lathe,
having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the center,
the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures... (33:b)
#+END_QUOTE

*** more divinity

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now when the creator had framed the soul [of the universe] according to his will, he formed within her the corporeal universe, and brought the two together and united them center to center. The soul, interfused everywhere from the center to the circumference of heaven,
of which also she is the external envelopment, herself turning in herself, began a divine beginning of never-ceasing and rational life enduring throughout all time.
#+END_QUOTE

In addition, heavenly bodies are themselves ensouled.

*** Structure of the Cosmos

-  circular
-  composed of bodies moving uniformly
-  with unspecified complex structures for irregularities

-  384-322 BCE
-  Plato's student
-  Alexander's teacher

*** His Importance

-  in medieval writings often just called "The Philosopher"
-  laid out a system of knowledge that persisted for thousands of years
-  helped lay foundations for theological & natural philosophic writings
  in /at least/ Christian, Islamic, and Jewish traditions
-  combined an emphasis on /precise empirical observation/ with
  /rigorous deduction/

*** Aristotle's Style and System

-  abandons dialogue
-  Builds a (largely!) self-consistent system across many fields of
  inquiry

** Aristotle's Natural Philosophy

*Four Causes*, *Natures*, and *theory of motion* at the heart of his physcial
theories
-  all natural phenomena must be explained in terms of these principles
*** Four Causes
-  Material
-  Formal
-  Efficient
-  Final
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Material :: the stuff it's made out of
- Formal :: the shape it takes
- Efficient :: The force or power which brings it into being or into this state (what we usually think of as a "cause"
- Final :: Its purpose
so, more causes than we accept; and also more room to discuss "meaning" in a causal account.
#+END_NOTES
*** Natures and Motion

-  /Nature/ of a being or substance explains its actions.
  -  nature of earth is to be at rest
  -  nature of fire is to move
-  When a body's state of being not in accord with its *nature*, that is because some /efficient/ cause is /acting on/ that body
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- It may seem strange but /the shape and system of the heavens is in many ways derived from the theory of motion/.
- So, perhaps even more than with Plato, the Universe is seen as /the effect of physical laws playing themselves out inevitably/.
#+END_NOTES
** The Heavens
- Terrestrial bodies, with their tendency to rest or move "rectilearly", also initiate in each other processes of change
- Celestial bodies are unchangeable, and embedded in a fifth element, *Ether* or *Aether*
  - move in a /circular/ fashion
*** The Spheres
Aristotle gets this from Eudoxus:
- Concentric spheres of aether rotate around the earth (center of
  Universe)
- each has its own motion, but is also carried by the motion of the
  outer sphere
[[https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebunn/homocentric/retrograde3.gif]]

*** But Where does this motion come from?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[E]verything that is in motion is moved by something... the first
principle that directly causes things that are in motion to be moved
is that which moves itself, and the first principle of the whole
series is the unmoved....

So the necessity that there should be motion continuously requires
that there should be a first movement that is unmoved even
accidentally...
#+END_QUOTE
There must be an Unmoved Mover! As perhaps an efficient but *certainly* a final cause

*** And how did it start?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
So the necessity that there should be motion continuously requires that there should be a first movement that is unmoved even accidentally, if... thre is to be in the world of things an unceasing and undying motion, and the world is to remain permanently self-contained... for if the first principle is permanent, the universe must also be permanent, if it is continuous with the first principle.
#+END_QUOTE
There can be no "first" motion!

(Because every motion or change requires a previous state of change)

** The divine

-  The "Unmoved Mover", as cause of everything that is, is divine
-  however, this entity is not *within* the universe

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time,
outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there, is of such a nature as
not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; nor is there any change
in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost motion; they
continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified,
living the best and most self sufficient of lives... From [the
fulfilment of the whole heaven] derive the being and life which other
things, some more or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy.
#+END_QUOTE

-  in fact, in its perfection, the unmoved mover *has no awareness of
  the world* but *solely contemplates itself*

** Aristotle: Summary

-  Homocentric Celestial Spheres!
-  An Eternal Universe!
-  An Eternal, self-contemplating God!
-  a *De-sacralized* Nature!

** The Ptolemaic system

-  Ptolemy: CE 90-168; Greek-speaking Egyptian living in Alexandria
  under Roman rule
-  inherited idea of celestial spheres from Eudoxus/Aristotle/Hipparchus;
-  and stellar observation records potentially from ancient Mesopotamians

*** The Physical Model
-  Homocentric spheres, several for each planet, like those described by
  Aristotle
-  Much more carefully specified!

- Uniform Circular motions, in "superposition", to create complex

*** Persistence and Problematics

-  Copernicus will eventually find it simpler to move the sun to the

*** To remember!
- immense philosophical & theological diversity over ~500 years
- enormous empire of many languages and ethnicities
- openness to local intellectual resources
- no "Pope", or single final religious authority! Political and religious strife that mirror each other to some extent, and final authority resing with the consensus position of "the learned". This despite the existenceo fhte /minha/, something like a religious inquisition.  
- absurd to speak of "the Islamic" /anything/, esp., say, "the Islamic view of science"
** Islam and Greek Philosophy
- Resuscitation of Ancient Traditions
- Massive Greek \rarr Arabic Translation Effort, esp. in 'Abbasid Caliphate (750-1258)
*** Making Translation Possible
- Even the Romans had translated only small parts of Greek classical corpus
- Why now?
  - Institutionalization of Arabic
  - Tolerance towards non-Muslim scholars
  - Patronage system
  - Emphasis w/in Islam on scholarly investigation
#+BEGIN_NOTES
so, Islam as /particularly/ suited to study (this is not the common perception in the contemporary west)
#+END_NOTES
*** Reason, Faith, and Aristotle
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
According to various sources, the caliph was visited one night by Aristotle, who granted him a series of questions. The caliph began with the
all-important one, "What is good?" to which the immediate answer was "That which is good in the mind." "And what then?" The answer: "That
which is good in law."
#+END_QUOTE
#+BEGIN_NOTES
al-Ma'mum (786-833), 'Abbasid caliph whose life would take a whole lecture to describe (succession struggle, war with brother, sieges, the works). 

This quotation shows that /rationality takes precedence over religious texts/

- not actually the "cause" of the translation movement, which was already underway; but a myth that tells us about values in the Abbasid dynasty.
- translation efforts "one of the most important intellectual events in human history", b/c it preserved and engaged with a tradition that otherwise would havebene lost (the Greek) while intermingling it with other traditions (esp Persian and Indian), and led esp. to mathematical developments which it then spread across eurasia.  
- depended on skills/languages of non-Muslims, so relied on the astonishingly tolerant multiculturalism of the Abbasid period, and baghdad in particular. 


How did the early adherents to Islam,
mainly cut off from the great intellectual traditions of antiquity, evolve in a
few generations into a cultural polity that would give rise to an intensive and
relatively organized translation movement that would make this possible? 17
Part of the answer lies in the rapid development of the Islamic community
into a sophisticated, multicultural empire under the early Abbsid caliphs,
at which time (the late eighth century) the translation movement began.
These caliphs, in addition to being defenders of the Islamic faith, often saw
themselves as successors to the great pre-Islamic Persian kings and encouraged
the translation into Arabic of not only Hellenistic science and philosophy but
also a substantial amount of pre-Islamic Persian and Indian material (both
scientific and literary). Islamic intellectuals thus gained an extraordinary
degree of access to these ancient traditions  rivaling, and in some cases
surpassing, our modern knowledge of them.
#+END_NOTES
*** Pre-Eminence of Aristotle
Two Traditions
- "Aristotelians": Aristotle as "The First Teacher", creator of a complete system
- "Neoplatonists": Plato as /completion/ of the Aristoelian system
  - esp, correcting gaps within Aristotle's metaphysics
- Philosophy as, in part, program of reconciling
  - /Aristotle with Himself/ and then
  - /Aristotle with Plato/ and finally
  - /Aristotle with Divine Revelation/
*** Emanations...
#+ATTR_HTML: :style max-width:49%; max-height 70%
[[file:~/RLG231/Images/Ptolemaicsystem-emanations.png]]
- Aristotle's God was /distant/
- Islam's God was /active/
#+BEGIN_NOTES
God's intellect infuses all other intellects, and directly causes everything in the Universe. 

"Neoplatonists advocated an emanation
of being from the highest celestial region through a hierarchy of spheres (the
Aristotelian/Ptolemaic celestial orbs) down to the sphere of the Moon, which
is closest to the Earth. This lowest level was associated both with Aristotles
agent intellect and Platos world of ideas that were accessible to those peo-
ple who purified their souls through the intense study of philosophy." (Ragep)
#+END_NOTES
*** And Other Questions
- Prophecy
  - Aristotle was /critical/ of notion of prophecy
  - Islam was /founded/ on prophecy
- The Soul
  - Aristotle saw the soul as a /formal/ cause of the self; was perhaps immanent to this life
  - Islam proclaimed the /immortality/ of the soul
- the World
  - Aristotle thought events had /natural causes/;
  - Islam saw God acting /directly in the world/ through /miracles/
** /Kalam/ and /falsafa/
Early division of "Transmitted" and "rationalized" knowledge
- with, for many, /reason/ at the root of both
- /kalam/ and /falsafa/

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- kalam is theology, one of a number of "religious sciences" which included e.g. grammar
- falsafa is the study of the ancients, Aristotle and the Neoplatonist intperpretations thereof esp. 

#+END_NOTES
** Al-Kindi: "the first Muslim philosopher"                        :noexport:
- "advocated the doctrine of creation ex nihilo" (ragep)
- explained prophecy in terms of Aristotelian psychology -- like Avicenna later on.
- defender of astrology
- helped to provide a role for mathematics in investigations of physical world. 
** Al-Farabi: The Second Teacher
- cosmopolitan 9th/10th Century Baghdad
- Hellenized christian philosophy
- canonical version of /emanation/ theory
- a /rationalist/ metaphysics that nonetheless exalted God as the cause of all things
  - God's knowledge as "cause and source of the existence of everything."
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- also seems to have abandoned attempts to reconcile ancient sicnece w/ Islamic theology, b/c he held philosophy to be /above/ theology or religion.

- Everything needs a cause
- Aristotelian "Prime Mover" an expression of God's /intellect/
  - All that is as an outcome of God's will

- "Active Intellect" \rarr unites God & human consciousness, but acts in the corruptible world
** Avicenna
- child prodigy ("By the age of 18, there was nothing I did not know")
- highly successful practicing physician
- great systematizer of philosophy

- Knowledge is /progressive/ and can be improved upon
- system and empiricism work together
*** Naturalism
- living things
- the Cosmos
- mind
- revelation
*** Logic at the root
- Syllogism: A \rarr B \rarr C

- How do we perceive the necessity of this relationship, and what guarantees it?
- as emanationism tells us: only God! 
#+END_NOTES
*** Human Intellect
- "congeneric" substance w/ divine intellect
  but resident in corruptible terrestrial sphere
- hence /mutable/ and potential
- intellection a process of /self-development/ that /stretches/ towards the incorruptible intellects above.
*** The Soul
- all "intelligibles" /object's of god's thoughts/
  - Divine Intellect overses things through their causes, but we only see /effects/
- logical syllogism a /process of contact/ between human and divine intellects
- ... as is prophecy
  - prophecy rendered *naturalistic*
*** The Work of Reason
- Reason as /habit which permits this (limited) divine contact/
- "Intimacy" of acquaintance with reason and object facilitates this apprehension
- *truths* and *divine intellect* eternal; *terrestrial knowledge* is progressive
- This is true, also, of /self-knowledge/, which we gain through similarly rationalistic means
- is this "mysticism"? *No*
*** The Soul, again
- Freed of the body, the soul has /potential/ to behold the causes
  - if it has been properly trained
- this is the nature of happiness and of paradise
*** An ethical Obligation
- duty to realize our intellects in their full potential
- an imperative to /refine/ and /perfect/ knowledge
*** Small Group
Discuss: What is the basis of our belief in logic? WHat strengths/weaknesses do you see in Avicenna's/ Ibn Sina's account of the "middle term"?
** Al Ghazali (1056-1111)
- Mystic and theologian
- /Incoherence of the Philosophers/
- mixed legacy
#+BEGIN_NOTES
In contrast to what is often claimed, Al-ghazali's work *advanced* the broader acceptance of Avicenna's work into mainstream Muslim theology (/falsafa/ accepted into /kalam/)

But, offered profound epistemological critique of /falsafa/, suggesting that they hadn't demonstrated all they claimed to have.

This is sometimes seen as a anti-scientific, and as "the end" of Muslim friendliness to science.

*** The Eye as Mechanism
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I know no better method of introducing so large a subject, than that of comparing a single thing with a single thing; an eye, for example, with a telescope. As far as the examination of the instrument goes, there is precisely the same proof that the eye was made for vision, as there is that the telescope was made for assisting it. They are made upon the same principles; both being adjusted to the laws by which the transmission and refraction of rays of light are regulated. I speak not of the origin of the laws themselves; but such laws being fixed, the construction, in both cases, is adapted to them.

    Sturmius held, that the examination of the eye was a cure for atheism. Beside that conformity to optical principles which its internal constitution displays, and which alone amounts to a manifestation of intelligence having been exerted in the structure... there is to be seen, in every thing belonging to it and about it, an extraordinary degree of care...

    What does chance ever do for us? In the human body, for instance, chance, i. e.the operation of causes without design, may produce a wen, a wart, a mole, a pimple, but never an eye. Amongst inanimate substances, a clod, a pebble, a liquid drop might be; but never was a watch, a telescope, an organized body of any kind, answering a valuable purpose by a complicated mechanism, the effect of chance. In no assignable instance hath such a thing existed without intention somewhere.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Another mechanical contrivance, not unlike the last in its object, but different and original in its means, is seen in what anatomists call the fore-arm; that is, in the arm between the elbow and the wrist. Here, for the perfect use of the limb, two motions are wanted; a motion at the elbow backward and forward, which is called a reciprocal motion; and a rotatory motion, by which the palm of the hand, as occasion requires, may be turned upward. How is this managed? The forearm, it is well known, consists of two bones....

A single bone in the fore-arm, with a ball and socket joint at the elbow, which admits of motion in all directions, might, in some degree, have answered the purpose of both moving the arm and turning the hand. But how much better it is accomplished by the present mechanism...

  Would it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!

- 1838: rereading Malthus
- overproduction; competition; struggle for existence
- how much greater in Nature!
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  A single pair of frogs might produce thousands of offspring every year!  Why was the world not overrun with frogs? (Browne, 387-8).  To overcome this superfecundity, there must be a kind of "war" within the species, a competition for survival, a struggle for existence, that allowed only the strongest to survive.

*** Descent with Modification
- human breeders (framers, also hobbyists)
- /divergence/ of child from parent

- /death/ as creative force
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  Was it possible that nature selected survivors as carefully as people selected breeders?  A natural selection analogous to artificial selection, that could account for both divergence of species and their adaptation to their environments?   Suppose 6 puppies born, he scribbled in his secret notebook:  some have longer legs than others.  in struggle for existence, maybe only two survive.  If some force in the environment favours long-legged dogs  whether natural or artificial  then in 10,000 years the long-legged breed would win out.
  #+END_NOTES
*** Natural Selection and Adaptation
- /nature itself/ selecting descendants
- impersonal force explains adaptation
- no need for "intelligent designer"
#+BEGIN_NOTES
here was an explanation of evolution far more powerful than Lamarcks
 an explanation which relied on no metaphysical life force, an explanation which demanded no increasing perfection.  Species changed in the direction demanded by the environment; but that didnt mean they got more perfect, just better-adapted.  All the theory needed was time  vast, unimaginable stretches of it.  And Lyell had already given Darwin as much time as he needed, and more.
#+END_NOTES
*** The Theory, Summarized
- *Superfecundity*    (from Malthus) combined with
- *Descent with Modification* (from breeders) leads to a
- *Struggle for Existence* (Malthus again) where survival rates are dictated by
- *Natural Selection*, by analogy to Artificial Selection (from breeders)
- Over *vast periods of time* (from Lyell),
- resulting in
- the *divergence of species* (from Galpagos bird species)
- and their seemingly perfect *adaptation* to their environment,
- into the full spectacle of *diversity* we see today.

TAGORE: What we call truth lies in the rational harmony between the subjective and objective aspects of reality, both of which belong to the superpersonal man.

EINSTEIN: We do things with our mind, even in our everyday life, for which we are not responsible. The mind acknowledges realities outside of it, independent of it. For instance, nobody may be in this house, yet that table remains where it is.

TAGORE: Yes, it remains outside the individual mind, but not the universal mind. The table is that which is perceptible by some kind of consciousness we possess.

EINSTEIN: If nobody were in the house the table would exist all the same, but this is already illegitimate from your point of view, because we cannot explain what it means, that the table is there, independently of us. Our natural point of view in regard to the existence of truth apart from humanity cannot be explained or proved, but it is a belief which nobody can lacknot even primitive beings. We attribute to truth a superhuman objectivity. It is indispensable for usthis reality which is independent of our existence and our experience and our mindthough we cannot say what it means.

TAGORE: In any case, if there be any truth absolutely unrelated to humanity, then for us it is absolutely non-existing.

EINSTEIN: Then I am more religious than you are!

TAGORE: My religion is in the reconciliation of the superpersonal man, the universal spirit, in my own individual being.

At first sight it seems that of all creeds none is so full of miracle... as Buddehism, which is, indeed, the very reverse of the truth. For to the supernatural Buddhism owes nothing at all. It is in its very essence opposed to all that goes beyond what we see of earthly laws, and miracle is never used as evidence of the truth of any dogma or any doctrine. (Fielding-Hall, 1898)

Buddhism is a scientific religion, in as much as it earnestly enjoins thtat nothing whatever be accepted on faith. Buddha has said that nothing should be believed merely becase it is said. Buddhism is tantamount to knowledge of other sciences. (Dharamapala, 1893)

Lopez, 192:
We thus see the claim of the Theosophist, that the most ancient is in fact the most modern, being claimed by the Buddhist, seeking to defend his religion agfainst the attacks of various enemies, both foreign and domestic. Indeed, the claim for a compatibility of Buddhism and Science offers a kind of defense against modernity, even striking out against it, by proclaiming that an ancient indian religion is a 'schience' and thus is modern.

** Buddhism & The Science of the Mind
*** Recap: Buddhism as "the Scientific Religion"
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A system which knows no God in the western sense; which denies a soul to man; which counts the belief in immortality a blunder and the hope of it a sin; which refuses any efficacy to prayer and sacrifice; which bids men look to nothing but their own efforts for salvation; which, in its original purity, knew nothing of vows of obedience, abhorred intolerance, and never sought the aid of the secular arm; yet spread over a considerable moiety of the Old World with marvellous rapidity, and is still, with whatever base admixture of foreign superstitions, the dominant creed of a large fraction of mankind. (Huxley, 1894)

- colonial assertion that Buddhism is mere "superstition"
- Theravada Buddhist rebuttal in 19th Century

- impermanence
- dependent origination
- no-self
- (emptiness)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Impermanence: everything, including persons, comes into being, persists temporarily, and ceases to exist.
- Dependent origination: all objects and events are the result of other objects and events; nothing causes itself
- no-self: there is no strong, unitary "self" or "atman"; instead, atman is an illusion caused by the mind
- emptiness: things have no "essences", as can be understood in part in impermanence; therefore, the heart of understanding is comprehension of no-essence, or "emptiness"
- interestingly strong link to compassion; note apparent contradiction, w/ compassion motivated somehow by what might otherwise by pure now-centred selfishness of a utility-maximizing no-self. 
#+END_NOTES
*** Is there a person?
- the problem in psychology
- the problem in Buddhism
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- interestingly, John Locke's /tabula rasa/ view of the mind has some similarities,and its definition of personal identity as a mere persistence of consciousness, ends up having some similarities if you take away the strong continuity of consciousness which Locke himself asserts
- in c. 20, the continuity of the self actually becomes an interesting empirical problem in psychology.
- "Buddhist metaphysics privileges processes and events... what there is, all there is, is an unfolding... in which we participate. What we call and conceive as 'things' are relatively stable processes or events inside the Mother of all unfolding" (Flanagan, "Boddhisatva's Brain" 97-98)

*** Fanon: Undestanding Resistance to Science 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In all objectivity and in all humanity, it is a good thing that a technically advanced country benefits from its knowledge and the discoveries of its scientists... But the colonial situation is precisely such that it drives the colonized to appraise all the colonizer's contributions in a pejorative and absolute way. The colonized perceives the doctor, the engineer, the schoolteacher, the policeman, the rural constable, through the haze of an almost organic confusion.... The compulsory visit by the doctor to the /douar/ is preceded by the assembling of the population through the agency of the police authorities. The doctor who arrives in this atmosphere of general constraint is never a native doctor but always a doctor belonging to the dominant society and very often to the army. (121)

Once the body of the nation begins to live again in a coherent and dynamic way, everything becomes possible. The notions about "native" psychology" or of the "basic personality" are shown to be in vain. The people who take their destiny into their own hands assimilate the most modern forms of technology at an extraordinary rate. (145)

  Who has laid out a channel for the downpour and for the thunderstorm a path
  To bring rain to no man's land, the unpeopled wilderness;
  To enrich the waste and desolate ground till the desert blooms with verdure? (/Job/ 38:25)

  Allah is He Who raised up the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then He settled Himself on the Throne, and constrained the sun and the moon to serve you; each planet pursues its course during an appointed term. He regulates it all and expounds the Signs, that you may have firm belief in the meeting with your Lord. (13:2)

  but:
  - acts through a hierarchy of /secondary causes/
    - /Laws/ that govern the ordinary actions of the world, in which God's action is immanent
    - /Angels/ intervening to send signs and aid
    - /Miracles/ in which God acts directly to override natural law
      #+BEGIN_NOTES
      - level of god's supervision of and invlvement in the secondary causes: god's omnipotence best revealed in /this action/ or /this delegation (Henry, Causation, p. 131)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The more private and common Laws of Motion [only hold until superseded by] some more catholick and indispensable Laws ... as the Statutes and Customs of private Corporations take place, till their power be suspended by some more catholick and inforcing Law of State. (Spencer, /Discourse Concerning Prodigies/, 1665 p.5, in Daston, "Miraculous Facts")

*** Occasionalism
- How does the world move from one state to another?
- No /logical necessity/ between subsequent states
- In every moment of causal efficacy, Gos /acts/ or at least /concurs/

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Al-Ghazzali: /logical necessity/ is coherent, but /causal necessity/ absurd, since it assumes correlation is causation
  - Mutakallims: atomism; indivsibles of time; recreation of Universe from instant to instant.
  - Christian occasionalism: God's providence guarantees lawlike regularity; but therefore God can suspend the action of natural Law
  - Descartes: God as "preserver of motion"
    - \rarr God's activity so obscure, easily removed...

- radical simplicity
- underlying geometrical vision
*** Newton
- 3 laws of motion: inertia; F=MA; Action-Reaction
- gravitation:

  $F={\frac{GmM}{r^2}}$
- single law to govern terrestrial and celestial motion
- world as "matter in motion"
- Room for God?
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Newton believed God acted from time to time to revive decaying Cosmos; e.g., comets
  - but still, if natural world is /solely matter in motion/, then little room remains for God
  #+END_NOTES
*** Deism
- many theological responses to these developments
  - e.g., Spinoza's "Panentheism": "Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner." (/Ethics/ 1:25S)
- Most prominent & novel: /Deism/
  - God as remote /clockmaker/ and /lawgiver/
  - Greatly diminished sphere of divine activity
** Wonders and Miracles
- Medieval distinction btwn /supernatural/ and /preternatural/:
  - /supernatural/: God's direct intervention (miracles: /violation/ of natural law)
  - /preternatural/: intervention of demons, angels, magicians, nature itself to produce /exceptions/ to natural order (wonders: /exceptions/ to law)
  - one reason why /facts/ are never adequate to determine /natural law/
#+BEGIN_NOTES
God's miracles violate only the lower order of causes, which exist only by God's will, leaving the higher order of causes, which depend  on  necessity,  intact.  Miracles  are  God's  unmediated  interventions  in  the  natural order, and hence "above nature." (Daston, "Miraculous Facts")

Hobbes: The proper domain of particulars, of facts, as they came to be called, was history, not philosophy: "The register of Knowledge of Fact is called History. Whereof there be two sorts: one called Naturall History; which is the History of such Facts, or Effects of Nature. ... The other is Civill History; which is the History of the Voluntary Actions of men in Common-wealths."47 History could contribute the raw materials and illustrations to natural philosophy-thus Aristotle's History of Animals was to prepare the way for a philosophical zoology-but by itself it was an inferior sort of knowledge, subordinated to the study of universals in philosophy or poetry.

*** Domestication of the Fact
- first "facts" in Natural Philosophy were oddities
- gradually move from /preternatural/ to /natural/ phenomena

*** End of The Miracle
- Eventual subsumption of /both/ miracles and wonders into /regular order of matter in motion
- /Vulgarity/ of wonders
- /Sufficiency/ of natural causes (Laplace, "I had no need of that hypothesis")
*** Resurrection of Wonder
- how do we capture the /state of wonderment/ and what is science supposed to do about it?
